#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE product="iPhone"

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?
SELECT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) AS average_spent FROM BIT_DB.FebSales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id WHERE quantity>2

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, sum(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%" GROUP BY product

#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT DISTINCT location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE location LIKE "%NY%" GROUP BY location HAVING count(orderID)>2

#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) AS quantity FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE product LIKE "%headphone%" GROUP BY product

#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id

#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT avg(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id

#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, sum(quantity*price) AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc LIMIT 1
